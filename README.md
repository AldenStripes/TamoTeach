# FraserHacks - TamoTeach
## Inspiration
As IB students from St. Francis Xavier, we know how repetitive and boring studying for IB exams are. They can be up to 100% of our final mark, but finding resources for exams can be incredibly difficult. We wanted to make studying fun and interactive for IB students while combining it with a creative pet game concept.

## What it does

Welcome to TomoTeach, an interactive pet game designed to help IB students ace their IB exams! Here’s how it works:

Study and Earn Tokens – By logging in and studying daily, you earn tokens
Meet Your Pets – On the home page, you’ll find your starter pets in a classroom. We even turned John Fraser’s school mascot, Jag. into an adorable companion! All art and animations are hand-drawn for a unique and personal touch.
Build Your Team – Use tokens in our claw-machine feature to pull for new characters! Once unlocked, they join your classroom.
Boost Stats – Buy food like cake, cookies and Candy from the shop to make your pets stronger and happier. But it’s not just about the pets; it’s about learning:

Lessons: On the lessons page, explore IB subjects and master key terms through engaging materials.

Battle to Test Knowledge: After exploring the lessons, put your skills to the test in battles! Answer subject-related questions to attack. Your pet’s stats determine how well you do! TomoTeach turns studying into an adventure where learning is fun and exams feel less daunting. It’s time to study smarter, not harder, with TomoTeach!

## How we built it
Next. JS, HTML, CSS, React

## Challenges we ran into
Balancing the educational content with fun gameplay was tricky. Creating the art and animations while ensuring the features worked smoothly was also challenging.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of the hand-drawn animations and how the game makes studying enjoyable. The claw machine feature and battle system turned out great too!

## What we learned
We learned how to integrate gamification with educational content and improved our skills in animation and game design.

## What's next for TomoTeach
We want to add more pets, expand the lessons to cover more IB subjects, and include multiplayer battles for a competition
